# ðŸ“ˆ yt-trend-scraper-api

A scraping API that returns trending videos based on a query. This is a **Next.js** project, designed purely as a lightweight back-end service. It uses zero external dependencies outside of Next itself. The entire API is contained within `api/search/route.ts`, making it simple to drop directly into another project.

This scraper is a modified version of [scraper-edge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scraper-edge). Itâ€™s designed for fast youtube scraping on cloud environments and can be easily integrated into any existing Next.js project.

**This project is:**

- âœ… An `/api/search` endpoint that scrapes YouTube search results
- âœ… Configurable for cache TTL, rate limits, and max result limits
- âœ… Simple and lightweight

## Features

- **Scrapes YouTube search pages** and extracts video data
- **Returns `JSON` payload** with title, link, channel, thumbnail, and views
- **In-memory cache** speeds up repeated requests
- **Rate limiting** protects from abuse per IP
- **Configurable settings** for cache TTL, rate limits, and max result limit

---

## How It Works

1. A `GET` request is made to `/api/search` with a search term.
2. The server checks the in-memory cache; if a result exists, it returns cached data.
3. If no cache, it scrapes the YouTube search results page, extracts embedded `JSON` (`ytInitialData`), parses video info, and sorts by view count.
4. The result is cached and sent back as a `JSON` response.

### /api/search

Query parameters:

- `q` (required): Search term
- `limit` (optional): Number of results (defaults to 1, maximum defaults to 4, all configurable)

Example local request using `curl`:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/search?q=lofi&limit=4"
```

Example response:

```bash
{
  "videos": [
    {
      "title": "Lofi Chill Beats",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123",
      "channel": "Lofi Girl",
      "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/abc123/hqdefault.jpg",
      "views": 1250000
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Returned fields:

- `title`: Video title text
- `link`: Full YouTube video URL
- `channel`: Uploaderâ€™s name
- `thumbnail`: Thumbnail image URL
- `views`: View count as number

## Configuration

Config variables can be found at the start of `route.ts`:

```bash
// Query limiting
const DEFAULT_LIMIT = 1;
const MAX_LIMIT = 4;

// Caching
const CACHE_TTL = 12 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 12 hours

// Rate limiting
const RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED = true;
const RATE_LIMIT_MAX = 20;
const RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60 * 1000; // 1 minute
```

This repository has the following `next.config.ts` file:

```bash
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/api/:path*",
        headers: [
          { key: "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", value: "true" },
          { key: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", value: "*" },
          {
            key: "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
            value: "GET,DELETE,PATCH,POST,PUT",
          },
          {
            key: "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
            value:
              "X-CSRF-Token, X-Requested-With, Accept, Accept-Version, Content-Length, Content-MD5, Content-Type, Date, X-Api-Version",
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

This is because if you're integrating this API into your own Next.js project and plan to call it from the client for example, using `fetch()` or `axios()`, you'll need to enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to avoid browser security errors.

By default, browsers block requests to your API if theyâ€™re not served from the same origin or donâ€™t have the proper headers. To allow these requests, this config is needed.

You do _not_ need CORS if the API is only ever called from server-side code (e.g. getServerSideProps, API routes, server actions, cron jobs).
